docu_clear
==========
notion:
 
to save those learning new programming languages from countless hours of tortuous, inefficient self study of unclear documentation. 

premise:  

learning a programming language isn't necessarily hard, but getting the information your brain needs to understand the documentation is. 

documentation can be easier to understand by following a system of conventions and protocols that all exist to make learning easier. 

docu_clear (working title) is this system. 

content:  

it is based on three pillars of communication:

context: what is the full context of the programming language? 

scope: what is the total scope of the programming language. 

definition: what is the most succinct way to describe a term within the programming language. 

impetus:  

i originally started with the idea of a soundcloud for documentation where users can identify the exact point where their comprehension of a topic described in documentation fails.

i don't know if it's the same for others but i'll be reading along (some documentation) and then bam (previously unexplained term is used) and i'm lost. 

so that's where the idea came from, and i just hate wasting time. most documentation is really hard to understand and it doesn't need to be. 

it would also be a newbie friendly place and have the premise that all explanations should cater to the absolute newbie.
