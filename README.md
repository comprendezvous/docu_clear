<b>notion</b>
 
to save those learning new programming languages from countless hours  
of tortuous, inefficient self study of unclear documentation. 

<b>premise</b>  

learning a programming language isn't necessarily hard, but getting the  
information your brain needs to understand the documentation is. 

documentation can be easier to understand by following a system of  
conventions and protocols that all exist to make learning easier. 

the system should be a newbie friendly place with all explanations catering  
for the absolute newbie.  

<b>background</b>  

the ideas started as a soundcloud for documentation where users could  
identify the exact point where their comprehension of a topic described  
in documentation fails.

<b>content</b>  

it is based on three pillars of efficient information transfer:

<b>context:</b>  
what is the full context of the programming language?

e.g. 'what is the notion, premise and background of the language?'

<b>scope:</b>  
what is the total scope of the programming language. 

e.g. 'where is a list of everyting in the programming language?'

<b>definition:</b>  
what is the most succinct way to describe a term within the  
programming language.
